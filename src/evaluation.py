            ModelEvaluator is a utility class for evaluating the performance of a question-answering model using a small, predefined dataset.
            Attributes:
                sample_data (list): A list of dictionaries, each containing a question, context, answer, and page number for evaluation.
                metrics (dict): A dictionary to store evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score, and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR).
            Methods:
                _create_sample_dataset():
                    Creates and returns a small evaluation dataset with questions, contexts, answers, and page numbers.
                _normalize_text(text):
                    Normalizes input text by converting it to lowercase and removing punctuation for fair comparison.
                _calculate_mrr(results):
                    Calculates the Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) based on the provided results.
                evaluate_model(query_processor, response_gen):
                    Evaluates the provided model using the sample dataset. It generates responses, extracts answers, and computes precision, recall, F1 score, and MRR.
                    Returns a dictionary containing the computed metrics and detailed results for each sample.
